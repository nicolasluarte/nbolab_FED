/********************************************************
 * ISSUE 1: FED will not compile and you get a bunch of errors related to Timelib
 * This may be a known issue with Timelib:
 * https://www.hackster.io/jkoger/simple-watch-using-rtc-59e635
 * and
 * https://github.com/arduino-libraries/RTCZero/issues/28
 * 
 * There is a solution from Sandeepmistry: 
 * As a work around, we would suggest you manually remove Time.h from <SKETCHBOOK>/libraries/Time/ if you wish to use both TimeLib and RTCZero in your sketch.

 
 * ISSUE 2: FED
